<h2>Brief Bio</h2>
<p>
  I am currently working in Distributed Data Intensive Systems Lab (Disl) under the supervision with <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~lingliu/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Ling Liu</a> and pursuing the Ph.D degree in School of Computer Science, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA. My research interests are in WiFi-GPS Localization, Deep Learning for Localization, Middleware Systems, Wireless Communications Systems, Wireless Sensor Networks and Embedded Systems.
</p>
<p>
  I received my Master degree with the major of Information and Communication Engineering from Beijing University of Technology (BJUT) in 2017. I worked as a research assistant in Modern Communication Technology Lab with Prof. Yanhua Zhang and Prof. Pengbo Si. Also, I received my Bachelor degree with the major of Electronic and Information Engineering from BJUT in 2014.
</p>
<p>
  Doing research and engineering projects is a crucial part of my studying career. I'm very lucky to participate in a number of projects and enjoy the process of struggle. Moreover, I also like talking with different types of people in my daily life. Communication is as interesting as Wireless Communications since when you talk with others, you know the way they think. Similarly, learning is as interesting as Deep Learning since when you collide with the strong, you know how weak you are and learn to become a strong.
